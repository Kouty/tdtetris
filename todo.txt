Tetris
- A tetromino spawns at the top of the playfield, in the middle column
- The upper most 2 rows are not visible to the player
- Tetromino can rotate, and it can move down, left and right
- When a tetromino reaches the bottom it is locked, and a new random tetromino spawns
- When a row is filled of pieces of locked tetrominoes, it gets deleted
- Game ends when a tetromino cannot spawn without colliding with locked tetromino pieces

TODO:
- Stop game after game over
- Score system
-- Score UX

DONE:
- pause
-- pause UX
- Next tetromino preview box
-- next tetromino on tetris
-- next UX

CONSIDERATIONS:
- Make clear algorithm (naive, or sticky) pluggable.
- Study and decide which game over conditions will be implemented
- Score system
