Some concepts:
- Tetromino
- Playfield
- Rotation
- Orientation
- Piece preview
- Row clear
- Locking

"I" Tetromino Tetris
New behaviour:
- "I" tetromino spawns at the top of the playfield, in the middle column DONE
- The upper most 2 rows are not visible to the player
- "I" tetromino cannot rotate jet, but it can move down, left and right DONE
- When "I" tetromino reaches the bottom it is locked, and a new "I" tetromino spawns DONE
- When a row is filled of pieces of locked tetrominoes, it gets deleted DONE
- Game ends when a tetromino cannot spawn without colliding with locked tetromino pieces*

TODO:
- Add an MVC framework to render playfield*

DONE:
- Tetris object, that will be used by a controller to let the user play tetris
- Game ends when a tetromino cannot spawn without colliding with locked tetromino pieces
-- Actually there are other optional game over conditions. Let's implement just this one, and note down the other conditions

CONSIDERATIONS:
- spawn is influenced by the rotation system
- there are 2 hidden rows at the top of the playfield
- Make clear algorithm (naive, or sticky) pluggable.
- Study and decide which game over conditions will be implemented
- Score system
- Other tetrominoes
- Random tetromino spawn
- Tetromino preview box
