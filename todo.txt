POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS/FEATURES
- There are more than one garbage clear algorithm. Now "naive" algorithm is implemented.
    Other algorithms could be implemented. See http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Line_clear
- Other ame over conditions could be implemented. Now impossibility to spawn the next element will
    cause game over. See http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Top_out
- Usually tetris games have levels. A level system may be added.
