Some concepts:
- Tetromino
- Playfield
- Rotation
- Orientation
- Piece preview
- Row clear
- Locking

One Column Tetris

OK, I don't known jet what's the first test, but with one column tetris, I am nearer to find out the what the first test should be.
Since TDD should be called BDD (Behavior-driven development), let's thing about the behaviours we need to implement One Column Tetris.

There is only "I" tetronimo, it starts at the top of the playfield, user can push it down with arrow down key, it slowly goes
downwards without any user interaction, when it reaches the bottom of the playfield, it should be locked, cleared and a new "I"
tetronimo enters the playfield.

So, let's start from the Tetrominoes spawm: each tetromino has a spawn position in the playfield. This means thinking of
a coordinate system. For now it's just the I tetronimo, and, since we have only one column, it will start at the top
of the playfield with 2 squares visible.
So let's say the bottom position is 0, the top is N, "I" tetronimo will occupy N,..., N-3 squares.

TODO:
- tetromino spawn position*

- spawn is influenced by the rotation system
- there are 2 hidden rows at the top of the playfield
- given the tetronimo mask (square containing the piece rotations), it spawns in the center and at the top of the 2 hidden rows.
