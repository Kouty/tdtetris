Tetris
- A tetromino spawns at the top of the playfield, in the middle column
- The upper most 2 rows are not visible to the player
- Tetromino can rotate, and it can move down, left and right
- When a tetromino reaches the bottom it is locked, and a new random tetromino spawns
- When a row is filled of pieces of locked tetrominoes, it gets deleted
- Game ends when a tetromino cannot spawn without colliding with locked tetromino pieces

TODO:
- Undo O spawn, http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/SRS. All tetrominoes start in the first 2 rows*
- Changing number of rows hidden from 2 to 1, so that all tetrominoes are partially visible

- Add other tetrominoes
-- Add "T"
-- Add "S"
-- Add "Z"
-- Add "J"
-- Add "L"

- pause

DONE:
- there are 2 hidden rows at the top of the playfield
- fix O span position
- Add other tetrominoes
-- Add "O" Done

CONSIDERATIONS:
- Make clear algorithm (naive, or sticky) pluggable.
- Study and decide which game over conditions will be implemented
- Score system
- Tetromino preview box
