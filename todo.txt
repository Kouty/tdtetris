Some concepts:
- Tetromino
- Playfield
- Rotation
- Orientation
- Piece preview
- Row clear
- Locking

"I" Tetromino Tetris
New behaviour:
- "I" tetromino spawns at the top of the playfield, in the middle column DONE
- The upper most 2 rows are not visible to the player
- "I" tetromino cannot rotate jet, but it can move down, left and right DONE
- When "I" tetromino reaches the bottom it is locked, and a new "I" tetromino spawns DONE
- When a row is filled of pieces of locked tetrominoes, it gets deleted*
- Game ends when a tetromino cannot spawn without colliding with locked tetromino pieces

TODO:
- When a row is filled of pieces of locked tetrominoes, it gets deleted*
-- since to implement garbage collection of tetrominoes cells a GarbageArea has been created, we can move tests of that
    inside its file.
-- There is naive gravity, and sticky gravity, for now we choose naive gravity
    (see http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Recursive_gravity)
- Check that a locked tetromino will fill all its area


DONE:
- Tetromino cannot move over garbage cells (remains of the locked tetrominoes)
- When "I" tetromino reaches the bottom it is locked and a new "I" tetromino spawns
- Tetromino cannot move outside the playfield*
-- More than fills(row, col) method, it is better to have a filledSquares() method

CONSIDERATIONS:
- spawn is influenced by the rotation system
- there are 2 hidden rows at the top of the playfield
