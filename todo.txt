So, we have now some concepts, for now let's just note down some of them:
- Tetromino
- Playfield
- Rotation
- Orientation
- Piece preview
- Row clear
- Locking

One way to approach the problem of the first test, is to reduce the requirements, we may thing of one column Tetris.
It may not be a good game to play, but it has almost every feature: there is the "I" tetronimo, it can be moved downward,
thet etronimo can be locked when touching the playfield base, also the line tetronimo should be cleared when it touches down,
since it fills every column (row clear algorithm).
