One Column Tetris

OK, I don't known jet what's the first test, but with one column tetris, I am nearer to find out the what the first test should be.
Since TDD should be called BDD (Behavior-driven development), let's thing about the behaviours we need to implement One Column Tetris.

There is only "I" tetronimo, it starts at the top of the playfield, user can push it down with arrow down key, it slowly goes
downwards without any user interaction, when it reaches the bottom of the playfield, it should be locked, cleared and a new "I"
tetronimo enters the playfield.
