Some concepts:
- Tetromino
- Playfield
- Rotation
- Orientation
- Piece preview
- Row clear
- Locking


OK, by focusing on the first test, and get it green (passed), I found out that positioning a tetromino in the Playfield
is one key point to develop the game.
So I feel that, more than continuing tests on the Playfield and 1 column tetris, it is worth now to focus on what
positioning a tetromino in the playfield means.

So, let's change the requirements from 1 column, to N column, but without rotation and only "I" tetromino exists.

"I" Tetromino Tetris
New behaviour:
- "I" tetromino spawns at the top of the playfield, in the middle column
- The upper most 2 rows are not visible to the player
- "I" tetromino cannot rotate jet, but it can move down, left and right
- When "I" tetromino reaches the bottom it is locked, and a new "I" tetromino spawns
- When a row is filled of pieces of locked tetrominoes, it gets deleted
- Game ends when a tetromino cannot spawn without colliding with locked tetronimo pieces

TODO:
- Given the tetromino mask (square containing the piece rotations),
    it spawns in the center and at the top of the playfield*

- Tetromino can be moved down, left and right
- Tetromino cannot move outside the playfield


DONE:
- Tetromino should tell which squares of the containing rectangle it occupies (useful also when introducing rotation)
- Each tetromino has a minimum containing rectangle
- tetromino spawn position
- Use typescript

CONSIDERATIONS:
- Coordinate system will refer to the top left tetromino square.
- spawn is influenced by the rotation system
- there are 2 hidden rows at the top of the playfield
